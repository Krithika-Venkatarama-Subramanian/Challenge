# Challenge

I wrote this code for my university assignment; I previously did not have much knowledge in GitHub. I wanted to use this submission as a process to learn basics of GitHub. 

Summary:

The python program is developed with object-oriented programming paradigm, named my_competition.py, that can read data from text files (challenges, students, and results) and perform the following operations.
1. Finding the student with the fastest average time
2. Finding the number of students finished the challenge
3. Finding the number of on-going students 
4. Finding the average time of each challenge
5. Finding the most difficult challenge or the challenge with the highest average time 
6. Finding the student with the fastest average time

The program is tested with different text files to ensure the program satisfies all the required functionalities.
This program has no interaction with users during execution. it simply runs the code, read the files, and display the desired message and generate the report text file my_competition.

To run the code: 

Clone my repository. 
In terminal type the following: python3 challenge.py challenges students reports
